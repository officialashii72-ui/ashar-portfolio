## 🎯 Why This Portfolio

Most developer portfolios fail at their one job: **getting you hired or booked**.

They list technologies. They hope someone cares. They look like every other Bootstrap template.

**This one is engineered differently.** Built around a single truth:

> *Clients don't hire skills — they hire outcomes. Recruiters don't read resumes — they scan for proof.*

This portfolio shows **what you've built**, **what problems you solved**, and **why someone should pick you** — all in under 5 seconds of attention.

---

## 🆚 What Makes It Different

| Typical Portfolio | Professionals Portfolio |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| "I know React" | "I built this product used by 10,000+ users" |
| Wall of skill badges | Curated proof of work |
| Generic Bootstrap clone | Custom-crafted, memorable design |
| Static, lifeless page | Interactive animations + working contact form |
| Slow load, bad SEO | Sub-2s load time, Google-indexed |
| "Contact me" | "Here's exactly how I can help your business" |
| npm hell, build errors | Zero dependencies, open and use in 60 seconds |

---

## 🎨 Customization Guide

Every part of this portfolio is built to be changed quickly. Here's exactly where everything lives:

### Colors & Branding

Edit `assets/css/styles.css` — change your entire color scheme in one place:

```css
:root {
  --bg:       #0b1020;   /* Page background */
  --accent:   #ff9800;   /* Primary brand color (buttons, highlights) */
  --accent-2: #00d8ff;   /* Secondary accent (gradients, hover states) */
  --muted:    #98a0b0;   /* Body text, secondary content */
}
```

### Content & Copy

Edit `index.html` — every section is clearly commented:

| Line | What to Change |
|------|----------------|
| `14` | Page `<title>` tag — your name + role (important for SEO) |
| `20–30` | Meta description and Open Graph tags |
| `56–60` | Hero headline and subheadline |
| `104–106` | About / bio section |
| `118–124` | Skills and technologies |
| `132–174` | Project cards — title, description, links |
| `198` | Contact email address |

### Typing Animation

Edit `assets/js/main.js`:

```javascript
const words = [
  "Web Applications",
  "Automation Systems",
  "UI/UX Experiences",
  "Landing Pages",
  "Your Custom Text Here"   // ← add as many as you want
];
```

### Social Links

Edit `index.html` near the footer:

```html
<a class="btn-ghost" href="https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME">GitHub</a>
<a class="btn-ghost" href="https://linkedin.com/in/YOUR_PROFILE">LinkedIn</a>
<a class="btn-ghost" href="https://twitter.com/YOUR_HANDLE">Twitter</a>
```

### 🔍 SEO Optimization (Don't Skip This)

For maximum Google visibility, update these tags in `index.html`:

```html
<meta name="description" content="YOUR NAME — Full Stack Developer & Automation Builder based in CITY. I build web apps, automation systems, and digital experiences that drive results.">
<meta property="og:title" content="YOUR NAME | Full Stack Developer Portfolio">
<meta property="og:description" content="Full Stack Developer specializing in web development, automation, and UI/UX design.">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://your-portfolio-url.com">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://your-portfolio-url.com/preview.png">
<link rel="canonical" href="https://your-portfolio-url.com">
```

Simple. No `/src`, no `/dist`, no `/node_modules`. Just files that work.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Deliberately minimal. Every choice has a reason.

```
Frontend:      HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
Hosting:       Netlify · Vercel · GitHub Pages (all free)
Forms:         Netlify Forms — no backend, no server, no cost
Fonts:         Google Fonts (loaded async, no render blocking)
Icons:         Inline SVG — no icon library overhead
Performance:   Lighthouse 95+ across all 4 categories
Dependencies:  0 (zero, none, nada)
Build step:    None required
```

**Why vanilla?** Because it loads faster, breaks less, and anyone can read and modify it. No framework version hell. No breaking changes from npm updates. Just HTML, CSS, and JS — the web's native languages.

---

## 📊 Performance
